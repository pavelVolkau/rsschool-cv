### **_About myself_**

---

One weekend, I realized that my job is simple and boring (I worked as an electrical engineer). And since during my studies I really liked the lessons related to programming and I was periodically interested in Python, I decided that it was worth trying myself along this path.
The choice fell on the Front-end, because when you study it, you can see what I do and how, and the obvious success motivates me.
I am inquisitive, I love to solve logical/algorithmic problems. I think that my strength is the ability to listen to an alternative point of view and, in the course of a dispute, come to a better solution (even if it is not mine).
I hope one day to get a job in a company where work will bring me pleasure, and communication with colleagues will bring me new interesting knowledge.
